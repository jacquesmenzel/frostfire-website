        <p>Your AC just died in the middle of a July heat wave. Or your furnace stopped working on a freezing January night. You need help <em>now</em> — but you've never called for emergency HVAC service before. What actually happens when you pick up the phone?</p>

        <p>Here's a step-by-step look at what to expect when you call Frost Fire for <a href="../services/emergency.html">emergency HVAC repair</a> in <a href="../service-areas/garner-nc.html">Garner, NC</a>.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: The Phone Call</h2>

        <p>When you call <a href="tel:9192304439">(919) 230-4439</a>, you'll speak with a real person — not an answering machine and not an overseas call center. We'll ask a few quick questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What's happening with your system? (No heat, no cooling, strange noise, water leak, etc.)</li>
          <li>When did it start?</li>
          <li>What type of system do you have? (Don't worry if you don't know — we'll figure it out)</li>
          <li>Your address and contact info</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Based on your answers, we'll give you an honest assessment of urgency and schedule a technician.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Quick Safety Check (While You Wait)</h2>

        <p>While you're waiting for the technician, there are a few things you can safely do:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>If you smell gas:</strong> Leave the house immediately and call 911 and your gas company. Don't flip any switches.</li>
          <li><strong>If you see water leaking:</strong> Turn off the system at the thermostat to prevent further damage.</li>
          <li><strong>If there's no cooling:</strong> Check your thermostat settings and air filter first — sometimes it's a simple fix.</li>
          <li><strong>If there's no heat:</strong> Check if the pilot light is lit (gas furnace) or if the breaker tripped (electric/heat pump).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 3: The Technician Arrives</h2>

        <p>Our techs arrive in marked vehicles with proper identification. Here's what a typical emergency visit looks like:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Listen and assess:</strong> We'll ask you to describe the problem and any symptoms you've noticed.</li>
          <li><strong>Diagnose:</strong> We inspect the system — checking electrical components, refrigerant levels, ignition systems, airflow, and controls.</li>
          <li><strong>Explain:</strong> We tell you exactly what we found and what it will take to fix it — <em>before</em> we start any work.</li>
          <li><strong>Get approval:</strong> You decide whether to proceed. No surprises, no pressure.</li>
          <li><strong>Repair:</strong> We carry common parts on our trucks for same-visit repairs whenever possible.</li>
          <li><strong>Test:</strong> We run the system and verify it's operating correctly before we leave.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How Long Does It Take?</h2>

        <p>For customers in <a href="../service-areas/garner-nc.html">Garner</a> and the immediate surrounding area, we typically respond within a few hours during business hours. During peak summer and winter seasons, demand is higher, but emergency calls are always prioritized.</p>

        <p>Most emergency repairs are completed in 1–2 hours on-site. If a special part is needed, we'll get it as quickly as possible and schedule a return visit — often the same day or next morning.</p>

        <h2>What Does Emergency HVAC Repair Cost?</h2>

        <p>Emergency pricing varies by the problem, but here's what makes Frost Fire different: <strong>we charge the same price on Sundays and weekends as we do on weekdays.</strong> Many HVAC companies add 50–100% surcharges for after-hours and weekend calls. We don't believe in that.</p>

        <p>You'll always get a clear quote before work begins. No hidden fees, no "well, while we're here" upsells.</p>

        <h2>Common HVAC Emergencies in Garner NC</h2>

        <p>The <a href="../service-areas/garner-nc.html">Garner</a> area experiences both extreme summer heat and occasional winter freezes. The most common emergencies we see include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AC compressor failure</strong> during July–August heat waves</li>
          <li><strong>Frozen evaporator coils</strong> from restricted airflow or low refrigerant</li>
          <li><strong>Furnace ignition failure</strong> on the first cold night of the season</li>
          <li><strong>Heat pump defrost issues</strong> during ice storms</li>
          <li><strong>Blower motor failure</strong> causing no airflow at all</li>
          <li><strong>Thermostat malfunctions</strong> after power outages</li>
          <li><strong>Refrigerant leaks</strong> causing warm air from the vents</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Reduce Your Risk of HVAC Emergencies</h2>

        <p>The best way to avoid emergency calls is preventive <a href="../services/maintenance.html">maintenance</a>. A twice-yearly tune-up catches small problems before they become big ones. Our <a href="hvac-maintenance-plan-pays-for-itself.html">maintenance plans</a> include priority scheduling for plan members — so if you do have an emergency, you go to the front of the line.</p>

        <p>Other ways to reduce risk:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Change your air filter every 1–3 months</li>
          <li>Keep the area around your outdoor unit clear</li>
          <li>Don't ignore unusual noises or smells</li>
          <li>Have your <a href="../services/ductwork.html">ductwork</a> inspected every few years</li>
        </ul>
